# ServiceNow Incident Management

This repository showcases my hands-on ability to manage **ServiceNow incidents from start to finish**, including:
- Creating new incidents
- Updating states and fields
- Assigning tickets
- Adding work notes & customer comments
- Troubleshooting and resolving issues
- Documenting activity logs professionally

## 🟦 Step 1 — Creating a New Incident
I created a new incident using the **Self-Service Incident View**, filling out essential info such as:
- Caller
- Short description
- Impact, Priority, and Urgency
- Initial state (**New**)

## Step 6 — Resolving the Ticket
Once the issue was fixed, I:

- Ensured the user regained full access
